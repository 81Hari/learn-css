            <p id="p1">Header has only 50%width and the h1 element is inside header so it has access only to it's parents area.But we declared h1 has only 50% access from it's parent. So in total it has only 25% access to total width (So the border is to small and font size is to big becasuse we used <code>em</code> in place of <code>rem</code>. So instead relative to the root it is relative to the parent.
            And it's only true for font-size Other than font-size it takes font size of the element itself(Margin for the border oh H1)</p>

                There is a another property called <code>ch</code> which used to limit character in the line.You can clear we have only 20 charcter in the line for the current paragraph.
